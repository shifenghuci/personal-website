          <p class="card-text">
    I was born in Guangzhou, China. It belongs to a greater area known as "Canton" (“粤” in chinese). I completed my high school and undergrad education in California.
    <br>
    I first step into gym in the summer after high school education, since then working out becomes an inseparable part of me.
    <br>
    Through out the years, my interst in fitness has extended to <a href="#portioning">nutrient control</a> and experimenting self-care technique in general. I am happy to have conversation on this topic.
    <br>
    The other thing I hold dearestly to my heart is a love of <em>Aesthetic and design</em>
    <br>
    I love to amaze on the wonderful design made by others.
    <br>
    I pay attentioned to the placement of object in my room, the color, the layout, and it is a hobby of mine to experiment different layout in regular basis
    <br>
    I also have a fond of appearance and outfit, <em><a href="https://popeyemagazine.jp">POPEYE</a></em> is my favorite magazine
    <br>
    For traditional art, the timeless pieces for me are drawings of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Mucha">Alphonsa Mucha</a></em>, who leads <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau">Art Noveau</a></em> movement
    <br>
    <em><a href="https://x.com/gtsleep1200?lang=en">@gtsleep1200</a></em>, is my favorite illustration artist, who posted in occasion on X (formely twitter), you can see some common theme between the illustrations to those of Mucha's
    <br>
    I like Jazz, R&B and anything that has a grain of either element.
    <br>
    My favorite band is <em><a href="https://chelmico.com">Chelmico</a></em>.
